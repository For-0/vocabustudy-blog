So the Quizlet Converter bookmarklet is kind of annoying

It's also annoying to maintain because:
1. I have to edit a oneliner
2. You have to keep copying the link if I update it (also I think it's broken rn because Quizlet)

I have a "better" idea: a Chrome Extension!

I'm thinking it will have a couple main features:

1. Going to https://vocabustudy.org/quizlet/12345678/view/ will bring up a temporary set that has the same terms as the Quizlet set. No login required for Quizlet or Vocabustudy!
2. Going to https://vocabustudy.org/quizlet/12345678/edit/ will bring up the set editor with the quizlet set prefilled. You can edit the set and save it as a Vocabustudy set from there
3. Going to https://quizlet.com/12345678/slug/vocabustudy/ will redirect to #1
4. A link will be added to the Quizlet set view page that redirects to #1

Example URLs for this states map set: https://quizlet.com/2334472/us-states-map-flash-cards/
1. https://vocabustudy.org/quizlet/2334472/view/
2. https://vocabustudy.org/quizlet/2334472/edit/
3. https://quizlet.com/2334472/us-states-map-flash-cards/vocabustudy/

obviously they don't work right now because you need the hypothetical extension

<small><em>The bookmarklet will continue to be maintained for usage on school devices</em></small>

Also side note but the district disabled the inspector ðŸ˜­

**Anyway let me know what you think *and if you would want this feature*** on the [feedback form](https://vocabustudy.org/forms/#feedback), Discord Server, by email, mail, postcard, word of mouth, carrier pigeon, telepathy, etc
